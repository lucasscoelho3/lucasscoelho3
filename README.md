### About me 🎯

Studying the Dart programming language in Flutter and seeking to improve my skills and knowledge as a developer.

I am passionate about art and technology and my goal is to be able to work in both areas in the future. Currently, I just work as a programmer in the IT area and sporadically do art and illustrations as a hobby.

I also love games and the development behind them. I have tried to study game development in the past, but I stopped and intend to explore this area again in the future and maybe work in it.
